This is a simple tool to explore the similarity between the representations of different concepts at different spatial positions in the h-space of diffusion models. The examples below are for Stable Diffusion 1.5, which has a h-space dimension of (50, 1280, 8, 8), i.e. 50 steps, 1280 channels, and 8x8 spatial resolution.
